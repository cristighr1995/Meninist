# Meninist
Two men must compete against each other to show off their masculinity. 

# How to play
There are three simple tasks: they must hit the food so that it will come into their fridge while not letting the other man have it;

They must hit the wrench so that it will come into their wrecked car while not letting the other man have it and the last one;

They must take out the garbage, in competition with another man.

# Platforms
It is simple, yet addictive, fun and competitive. It can be played in any platform - we developed it so one can play with joystick, and the other one with the keyboard. Simple modifications can be made

This version is playable just with the keyboard.

First player with W, A, S, D and space to shoot
